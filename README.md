## Introduction
This repository contains Python code that analyzes car statistics based on a provided dataset. The code uses the pandas library to load and process the data, and it utilizes matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations. The main focus of the analysis is on MPG (miles per gallon), but other aspects such as calculating statistics, filtering, and exploring the data are also covered.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required3. Place your car dataset file (e.g., car_data.csv) in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the Python script (e.g., analyze_cars.py) to perform various analyses and computations on the car data.
5. The results will be displayed in the console and visualizations will be saved as image files.

## Tasks
The code in this repository accomplishes the following tasks:
- Reads a car dataset in CSV format into a pandas DataFrame.
- Retrieves the column names of the dataset.
- Finds the car with the highest MPG.
- Finds the car with the lowest MPG.
- Calculates the average MPG of all cars.
- Determines the most common MPG value.
- Performs visualizations of the data, including histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
